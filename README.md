# SystemIdentificationProject
This project involved identifying a system based on an input signal generated by a Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO) with increasing frequency. The system had two output signals corresponding to two different configurations: one with a zero and one without. The identification process was carried out using a non-parametric method and plot multiple points on the system's Bode diagram. Additionally, two parametric identification methods were applied to both system configurations.
